        <span class="header">Experience</span>
        <p class="paragraph">My experience in learning the basics of web developement has been with many ups and downs but besides that I have been very positive about the growth I am finding in myself. I must admit that beginning few days or week were very overwhelming but
            as the practise and patience keep on growing these days I feel like I am learning new things every other day and have been improving on my coding skills. I first found my debugging skills at its worst, I could not find the problem that was
            causing it (primarily in css) and any help from the web also deemed useless. I would consider those days as the timeframe I felt most down, but gradually I have been improving my debugging skills and I say is still in the process of improvement.
            I must say that the course module and help from Professor and my friends has been a diving factor for the improvement in the area of web development for me.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> The course module and teaching standards has been at it's best, where we can learn about web-development from the basics. Starting with HTML, which is for creating the skeleton of any project to adding css to beautify the appereance in such a
            way that user interface looks well furnished with in mind for user experience that we can provide to users, which helps user to easily use the provided service.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The user interface I have developed is fairly simple, as me myself came up with the current UI. Though the UI is simple I have added some minor but key piece of codes, that will make the user experice better like hover effects, pointer cursor
            that user will be able to know the area is clickable. About the color combination, I did not referenced with any of sites available on market, but choosed a random color for navbar from color picker which was Yellow. But after that I searched
            for the colors that can be combined with the Yellow and came up with the current blue and white color. I have used only these three colors throught the site to keep the site look pleasing. </p>
